Check if flask is installed using the command
pip freeze

If you can't see flask on that list, install using
pip install Flask

from the directory with apiTest.py run
env FLASK_APP=apiTest.py flask run

This will let you know where the app is running, ie http://127.0.0.1:5000/

To see a list of authors or categories, add /authors or /catgories on the end of this url

To see a specific Author or category, add /author/*authorsname* or /category/*categoryname* to the end of this url

example : http://127.0.0.1:5000/author/Robin%20Nixon

To filter this authors books by category (or categories books by author) add this on to the end of the url

examples : http://127.0.0.1:5000/author/Robin%20Nixon/linux
http://127.0.0.1:5000/categories/linux/robin%20nixon

You can use the terms categories and category interchangeably, as well as authors and author. Capitalisation is filtered out.

To add a new book, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/add/
